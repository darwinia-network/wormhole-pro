# Getting Started

## Installation

1. clone this repo `git clone ...`;

1. install dependance `yarn install`;

Then happy coding!

## Attention

This boilerplate include some base UI libraries and some util libraries, e.g: ant-design, date-fns, lodash etc, but without a router library so you need to
install one yourself.

We suggest that use tailwind css to reduce the css coding tasks, and it is available now. If you plane to work with it, strongly recommended to install the **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** plugin in your vscode.
